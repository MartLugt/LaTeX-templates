	abstract = {Phosphodiesterases ({PDEs}) comprise a large family of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of {cAMP} or {cGMP} and are implicated in various diseases. We describe the high-resolution crystal structures of the catalytic domains of {PDE}4B, {PDE}4D, and {PDE}5A with ten different inhibitors, including the drug candidates cilomilast and roflumilast, for respiratory diseases. These cocrystal structures reveal a common scheme of inhibitor binding to the {PDEs}: (i) a hydrophobic clamp formed by highly conserved hydrophobic residues that sandwich the inhibitor in the active site; (ii) hydrogen bonding to an invariant glutamine that controls the orientation of inhibitor binding. A scaffold can be readily identified for any given inhibitor based on the formation of these two types of conserved interactions. These structural insights will enable the design of isoform-selective inhibitors with improved binding affinity and should facilitate the discovery of more potent and selective {PDE} inhibitors for the treatment of a variety of diseases.},

	abstract = {The African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular pathogen that causes lethal sleeping sickness in humans, which is a devastating and neglected tropical disease that is endemic to vast regions of Africa. T. brucei also infects wild and domestic livestock, which limits sustainable development, and it is thus considered to be both a cause and consequence of poverty.T. brucei has a single flagellum that is present throughout the parasite and its life cycle. The flagellum has conserved and unique features. It emerges from a membrane invagination at the posterior end of the cell and remains attached to the cell body for most of its length.The flagellum contains cytoskeletal structures, which are ensheathed by a specialized flagellar membrane that interfaces with the external environment and that has a protein and lipid composition that is distinct from the rest of the cell surface. The T. brucei flagellum has multiple functions and is essential for parasite motility, viability, transmission and pathogenesis.Flagellum-mediated motility is powered by the axoneme, which is a biological machine that converts dynein motor structural changes into flagellum beating and parasite propulsion. T. brucei motility is crucial for movement through host tissues and provides a surprising immune-evasion mechanism.In addition to motility, the T. brucei flagellum is an important morphogenetic hub that controls cell shape and size, directs organelle segregation and governs cell division. These functions are modulated during developmental transitions of the parasite and are achieved by the direct or indirect physical connections of the flagellum to other cellular elements.The flagellum is a crucial host–pathogen interface that has important roles in parasite transmission and virulence. Flagellar proteins mediate attachment to host tissues, carry out uptake of host growth factors and promote parasite survival by inhibiting host immunity.T. brucei is an excellent model system to study the biology of the highly conserved eukaryotic flagellum and offers valuable insights into how flagella assemble, move and sense the environment. Continued studies of the T.brucei flagellum hold the promise of having a great impact on human health, as human flagella are paramount in human development and physiology. In addition, the flagella of many human pathogens are salient but unexplained structures that await further study.},

Here we demonstrate novel roles for the flagellum in the control of cell size, shape, polarity and division of the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. To investigate the function of the flagellum, its formation was perturbed by inducible {RNA} interference silencing of com ponents required for intraflagellar transport, a dynamic process necessary for flagellum assembly. First, we show that down‐regulation of intraflagellar transport leads to assembly of a shorter flagellum. Strikingly, cells with a shorter flagellum are smaller, with a direct correlation between flagellum length and cell size. Detailed morphogenetic analysis reveals that the tip of the new flagellum defines the point where cytokinesis is initiated. Secondly, when new flagellum formation is completely blocked, non‐flagellated cells are very short, lose their normal shape and polarity, and fail to undergo cytokinesis. We show that flagellum elongation controls formation of cytoskeletal structures (present in the cell body) that act as molecular organizers of the cell.},

	abstract = {Cyclic nucleotide specific phosphodiesterases ({PDEs}) are pivotal regulators of cellular signaling. They are also important drug targets. Besides catalytic activity and substrate specificity, their subcel-lular localization and interaction with other cell components are also functionally important. In contrast to the mammalian {PDEs}, the significance of {PDEs} in protozoal pathogens remains mostly unknown. The genome of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human sleeping sickness, codes for five different {PDEs}. Two of these, {TbrPDEBl} and {TbrPDEB}2, are closely similar, {cAMP}-specific {PDEs} containing two {GAF}-do-mains in their N-terminal regions. Despite their similarity, these two {PDEs} exhibit different subcellular localizations. {TbrPDEB}1 is located in the flagellum, whereas {TbrPDEB}2 is distributed between flagellum and cytoplasm. {RNAi} against the two {mRNAs} revealed that the two enzymes can complement each other but that a simultaneous ablation of both leads to cell death in bloodstream form trypanosomes. {RNAi} against Tbr-{PDEB}1 and {TbrPDEB}2 also functions in vivo where it completely prevents infection and eliminates ongoing infections. Our data demonstrate that {TbrPDEB}1 and {TbrPDEB}2 are essential for virulence, making them valuable potential targets for new {PDE}-inhibitor based trypanocidal drugs. Furthermore, they are compatible with the notion that the flagellum of T. brucei is an important site of {cAMP} signaling.—Oberholzer, M., Marti, G., Baresic, M., Kunz, S., Hemphill, A., Seebeck, T.

	abstract = {Tryptophol (3-indole ethanol) is a compound which induces sleep, and is formed: (a) in the liver after disulfiram treatment, and (b) by the parasite in trypanosomal sleeping sickness. We prepared, purified, and characterized radiolabeled tryptophol for the purpose of defining its tissue distribution in animals. Tryptophol was found to be highly lipophilic, with an octanol:water partition coefficient of 29.8. Brain extraction, determined after intracarotid injection, was high (brain uptake index = 117 +/- 3.5\%), and nonsaturable, suggesting the absence of a carrier system. After intravenous administration, tryptophol distribution to tissues correlated with relative blood flow. More than 85\% of the radioactivity remaining in brain 2-5 min after intravenous injection co-migrated with tryptophol standards when analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. Other evidence suggested that tryptophol binds to serum and in vivo may be stripped from serum albumin and taken up by brain in a single capillary transit. Our study suggests that in states such as trypanosomal sleeping sickness or disulfiram treatment, remotely formed tryptophol gains ready access to brain (it is 100\% cleared in a single capillary passage), and could thus cause somnolence.},

The highly conserved human homologs are well-established drug targets. We here describe what is to our knowledge the first pharmacological validation of trypanosomal {PDEs} as drug targets. High-throughput screening of a proprietary compound library identified a number of potent hits. One compound, the tetrahydrophthalazinone compound A (Cpd A), was further characterized. It causes a dramatic increase of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate ({cAMP}). Short-term cell viability is not affected, but cell proliferation is inhibited immediately, and cell death occurs within 3 days. Cpd A prevents cytokinesis, resulting in multinucleated, multiflagellated cells that eventually lyse.

	abstract = {Background Human African trypanosomiasis ({HAT}), also known as sleeping sickness, persists as a public health problem in several sub-Saharan countries. Evidence-based, spatially explicit estimates of population at risk are needed to inform planning and implementation of field interventions, monitor disease trends, raise awareness and support advocacy. Comprehensive, geo-referenced epidemiological records from {HAT}-affected countries were combined with human population layers to map five categories of risk, ranging from “very high” to “very low,” and to estimate the corresponding at-risk population. Results Approximately 70 million people distributed over a surface of 1.55 million km2 are estimated to be at different levels of risk of contracting {HAT}. Trypanosoma brucei gambiense accounts for 82.2\% of the population at risk, the remaining 17.8\% being at risk of infection from T. b. rhodesiense. Twenty-one million people live in areas classified as moderate to very high risk, where more than 1 {HAT} case per 10,000 inhabitants per annum is reported. Discussion Updated estimates of the population at risk of sleeping sickness were made, based on quantitative information on the reported cases and the geographic distribution of human population. Due to substantial methodological differences, it is not possible to make direct comparisons with previous figures for at-risk population. By contrast, it will be possible to explore trends in the future. The presented maps of different {HAT} risk levels will help to develop site-specific strategies for control and surveillance, and to monitor progress achieved by ongoing efforts aimed at the elimination of sleeping sickness.},
